## Hi, I'm Marco 👋

Product Manager turned Web3 builder, working at the intersection of AI and crypto infrastructure.

I spent 3.5+ years as a Product Manager in e-commerce, leading and shipping large-scale initiatives across user growth, authentication, security, compliance, logistics, and system scalability.

Today, I build decentralized systems focused on AI agents, on-chain incentives, and programmable financial infrastructure.

Along the way, I’ve become:
- 🏆 ETHGlobal Finalist  
- 🏆 Token2049 Finalist  
- 🏆 Uniswap Hook Incubator Top 8  

Bridging product thinking with engineering.
